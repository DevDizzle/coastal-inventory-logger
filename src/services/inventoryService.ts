 * Saves a batch of inventory entries.

 * 1. Calling a custom API endpoint (e.g., an Azure Function) that uses the SharePoint API.
 * 2. Triggering a Power Automate flow via an HTTP request.
 *
 * The `items` array and `userEmail` are passed to this function,
 * containing all the necessary data for the submission.
 *
 * @param items - An array of staged inventory items.
 * @param userEmail - The email of the user submitting the entries.
 * @returns A promise that resolves when the operation is complete.
